# Tombs of the Ancient Kings
This is a project developed from a tutorial by [TStand90](https://github.com/TStand90) (original tutorial found [here](https://rogueliketutorials.com/).

Feel free to provide feedback/raise any issues you may run into when you play the game. 

## Changelog
Version 1.0 - This is the state of the game right after finishing the tutorial linked above (with a few minor tweaks to things like the name of the window, welcome text, etc.). Current, stable build.

### To Do:
- [ ] Adjust monster difficulty
- [ ] Add in-game Help menu to display things like controls, or any other relevant information.
- [ ] Add in some new items/spells
- [ ] Expand ability to have more than one savegame file
- [ ] Add way to save game without having to exit

## Controls
Until I have the in-game help menu set up, this is the best I can do:

### Movement
You can use several differnt keys to move your rogue around the dungeon. The currently supported movement keys are:

- Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- Numpad Keys:
  -  **8:** Move Up
  -  **2:** Move Down
  -  **4:** Move Left
  -  **6:** Move Right
  -  **7:** Move Up, Left
  -  **9:** Move Up, Right
  -  **1:** Move Down, Left
  -  **3:** Move Down, Right

### Interaction

**C** -  Open character menu

**G** -  Pick up items

**I** -  View inventory

**D** -  Drop item

**V** -  View message log history

**/** -  Enable look mode (allows you to use your mouse/movement keys to move the curor around the dungeon to get the labels of things

**>** -  Use stairs (You will have to actually type the '>' symbol by using Shift + .

> [!NOTE]
> Note: Use the letters that coorespond to the menu item to interact with it inside of the menu (consuming a potion, equipping/unequipping an item, dropping an item, etc.)
